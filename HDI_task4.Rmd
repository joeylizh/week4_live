# Ineqaulity task - week 4

## Reproduce 

### package versions

```{r first, eval=FALSE}
# i have taken a snapshot with
#renv::snapshot()

#install the same packages
#renv::restore()
```
### Read in data:

Located within the Data folder:

* HDI data from: http://hdr.undp.org/en/indicators/68606#
* Shapefile from: https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/2b93b06dc0dc4e809d3c8db5cb96ba69_0/explore?location=-2.688200%2C0.000000%2C1.41 

## Load packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(here)
library(janitor)
library(countrycode)
```

```{r}
HDI <- read_csv(here::here("Data", "Gender Inequality Index (GII).csv"),
                       locale = locale(encoding = "latin1"),
                       na = "..", skip=5)
World <- st_read(here::here("Data", "World_Countries__Generalized_.shp"))
```

## Column names

Select columns we want and change country name to country code, using the `countrycode` package

We could also just join it without this on the country name column 

```{r}
HDIcols<- HDI %>%
  clean_names()%>%
  select(country, x2019, x2010)%>%
  mutate(difference=x2019-x2010)%>%
  slice(1:189,)%>%
  mutate(iso_code=countrycode(country, origin = 'country.name', destination = 'iso2c'))
  

#this was just a test. hello
#t <- countrycode(HDIcols$country, origin = 'country.name', destination = 'iso2c') 

```

## Join

Join the csv to world shape file

```{r}
Join_HDI <- World %>% 
  clean_names() %>%
  left_join(., 
            HDIcols,
            by = c("aff_iso" = "iso_code"))
```

...next time we will make a map using different repos


local change
